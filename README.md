# Student Performance Analysis: Advanced Data Cleaning, EDA and Feature Engineering 

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a dataset focused on student performance. The project leverages advanced techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (Random Forest) to identify the most critical factors influencing students' exam scores.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- **StudentPerformance.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file, including all the code for data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, and model fitting.
- **StudentPerformanceFactors.csv**: The Student Performance dataset. [Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors).

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights :

- **Attendance** emerged as the most critical factor affecting student performance, contributing significantly to higher exam scores.

- **Hours Studied** and **Previous Scores** were also strong predictors of success, emphasizing the importance of consistent study habits and academic history.

- Other factors such as **Tutoring Sessions**, **Access to Resources**, and **Sleep Hours** had moderate impacts, highlighting the importance of a well-rounded approach to education.

- Demographic variables, such as **Parental Education Level** and **Family Income**, had smaller but still noticeable influences on performance.
